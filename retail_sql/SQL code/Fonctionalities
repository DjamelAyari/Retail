/*INSIDE THE C SERVER/CLIENT CODE*/
WHEN A CLIENT IN THE HTML PAGE WILL INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE AN ARTICLE VIA THE HTML PAGE IT NEED TO HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE ORDERS TABLE AND THE ORDERS_DETAIL TABLE.
THE SQL QUERY FOR THAT WILL TAKE INSIDE THE C SERVER/CLIENT CODE.

IF THE CUSTOMER PUT AT LEAST ON ARTICLE IN HIS CART, IT WILL HAVE AN IMPACT:
	-IT NEED TO FIRST CREATE A NEW ORDERS ROW IN THE ORDERS TABLE AND THEN CREATE A NEW ROW IN THE ORDERS_DETAIL TABLE.
	-UNLESS THE CLIENT DELETE HIS CART COMPLETLY, IT WILL STAY THE SAME ORDERS AND FROM THIS IT WILL ONLY ADD A ORDERS_DETAIL ROW IN THE ORDERS_DETAIL TABLE.
	-THE DEFAULT STATUS IN THE ORDERS TABLE WILL BE PENDING UNTIL FURTHER ACTIONS FROM THE CLIENT LIKE PAYING HIS ORDER.

IF THE CUSTOMER MAKE DELETIONS IT NEED TO DELETE THE ORDERS_DETAIL TABLE ROWS AND IF THERE ARE NO MORE ARTICLE IN THE ORDERS_DETAIL TABLE IT WILL DELETE THE ORDERS TABLE ROW.

FOR THE UPDATE PART THE CLIENT CAN ONLY CHANGE THE QUANTITY WANTED IN THE ORDERS_DETAIL TABLE.



ENUM('Pending', 'Processing', 'Shipped', 'Delivered', 'Completed', 'Cancelled', 'Returned', 'Refunded', 'On Hold', 'Failed')

The cancelled options can take place for the customer if he cancelled his order in a limited periode of time and so before shipping.
